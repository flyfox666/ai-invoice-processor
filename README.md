FlexiVoice is an intelligent invoice processing tool designed specifically for **finance and administrative personnel without a technical background**. It completely revolutionizes the tedious traditional process of manual data entry, making advanced AI technology accessible to everyone.

The most significant feature of this application is its **extremely lightweight, pure front-end architecture**. Users do not need to install any software or rely on a back-end server. All data processing and AI calls are securely completed within the user's local browser, ensuring data privacy and providing an "out-of-the-box" user experience. At its core is a powerful **multi-modal large language model** that can "read" and understand various invoices just like a human. Whether it's a standard electronic PDF or a scanned image of an invoice from a phone, the system can achieve high-precision extraction of key information.
